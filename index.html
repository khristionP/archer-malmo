		<h2>Before the trip</h2>
	<p>
		Everybody was excited for the Archer Malmo school field trip. Some people, including myself, have not been on a field trip in high [school or middle school, so this was an exciting moment. Everyone was excited when Mrs. Sinclair told both of her classes that we were going on a field trip. And the field trip was free. All we had to do was pay for our lunch at Cook Out. After second period, we had to put our backpacks in her classroom and go to the main lobby to wait on the bus that was taking us to Downtown Memphis. We load the bus and we are on our way.

		<h2>The bus ride</h2>
	<p>
		The bus ride was not fun bus was not boring either. It was kind of long, so on the bus we just slept, played games on our phones, chatted and look outside the bus. The bus was full so nobody could have a seat to themselves, which sucks. Everyone had to pick a "buddy" to make sure they did not get lost and knew who they sat by.

		<h2>Archer Malmo</h2>
	<p>
		What is Archer Malmo? They are is a strategic brain, a creative soul and an independent spirit, wired for adaptation in a culture that never stops demanding it. Our strength is our ability to help growing brands evolve both digitally and creatively to compete with bigger (and smaller) rivals. Lots of big name companies and even smaller companies go to them when or if they want a website created or fixed. They have an office in Memphis, Tennessee and one in Austin, Texas. The office seemed like a good environment to work in. It also seems like the workers are good people. The workers are allowed to bring their dogs to work, if they have one. They have a ping pong table for fun, a large white board, and other fun things. We went to about 3 or 4 floors of their office. I do not know how many floors of office space they have.

		<h2>The Speaker</h2>
	<p>
		The speaker was not planned to speak to us on Thursday. He was boring, and lots of people were going to sleep when he was presenting and talking about what he does and how Archer Malmo works. He showed us a couple of projects that him and his co workers are or were working on. They sometimes have problems with their clients and get frustrated.

		<h2>Cook Out</h2>
	<p>
		After going to Archer Malmo, we walked back to the bus and waited. It was cold waiting on the bus and the bus was late, it just left us in the cold. We got on the bus and went to Cook Out to eat lunch. Some people on the field trip have never been to Cook Out and they were excited because it was their first time going. People tried to get on the bus first so we could get first in line and order before everyone else. I got a burger, double order of fries, and a large pink lemonade.

		<h2>The way back</h2>
	<p>
		On the way back was like the way up to Archer Malmo. Once again, it was not boring but not fun. We played imessage games, snapchat, slept, and other things that teenagers do on long bus trips. Everybody liked the trip but was not happy to go back to school and learn.
